Implement a simple graphical client based on the API from the main
specification. You can use pygame or pyglet for this. Specifics are
up to you. I will ask you to submit a short demo video in addition
to the code (presumably through the IS, I will post the details in
the DF). You can earn 1.5 points for this extension. The deadline is
30th of January.
