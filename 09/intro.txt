# Programming Exercises

This week will consist of a few generic exercises, since the lecture
does not cover a specific topic.

 1. ‹alchemy.py› – transmute and mix inputs to reach a goal
 2. ‹minieval.py› – evaluate simple lisp-y expressions
 3. ‹word-chain.py› – solve a simple puzzle
 4. ‹reduce.py› – reduce composite values with a bit of Python magic
 5. ‹cycles.py› – a simple graph algorithm

Submit ‹minieval›, ‹alchemy› and/or ‹cycles› for 0.5 points each.
