# You are given a graph, in the form of a dictionary, where keys are
# numbers and values are lists of numbers (i.e. it is an oriented
# graph and its vertices are numbered; however, note that the
# numbering does «not» need to be consecutive, or only use small
# numbers).

# Write a function, ‹has_cycle› which decides whether a cycle with
# at least one even-numbered vertex is reachable from vertex 1.

# Hint: look up Nested DFS. Essentially, run DFS from vertex 1 and
# when you backtrack through an even-numbered vertex (i.e. in DFS
# postorder), run another DFS from that vertex to detect any cycles
# that reach the (even-numbered) initial vertex of the inner DFS.
# All the inner searches should share the ‘visited’ marks. Be
# careful to implement the DFS correctly.
