Write a simple chat server that accepts connections on a UNIX domain
socket, which it should create in its working directory with the
name ‹chatsock›. It should implement a simple protocol with the
command types described below. Each command is an expression of the
lisp-like language described in hw3. In the direction from client to
server:

    (nick "{nickname}")
    (join "{channel}")
    (message "{channel}" "{text}")
    (part "{channel}")
    (replay "{channel}" {unix timestamp})

And in the opposite direction:

    (ok)
    (error "{text}")
    (message "{channel}" {unix timestamp} "{nickname}" "{text}")

Both ‹{nickname}› and ‹{channel}› are alphanumeric strings without
spaces, the latter must start with a ‹#› while the former must not
start with a ‹#›. Unix timestamp is an unsigned integer denoting the
number of seconds elapsed since midnight, 1.1.1970. ‹{text}› is any
utf-8 string with no newlines in it. The server should respond to
unknown or malformed commands with an ‹error›.

Upon connecting, the client sends the ‹nick› command. The server
accepts it and replies ‹ok› unless the nickname is already in use by
another connected client, in which case it replies ‹error›. It is
also an ‹error› to send any other command before ‹nick› has been
accepted.

The ‹join› command associates the client which sent the command with
the given channel. Joining an already-joined channel is an ‹error›.
Channels are transparently created when the first client joins them,
and are never destroyed. The ‹part› command removes the association
of the client with the channel. It is an ‹error› to part a channel
that is not joined. Both confirm the action with an ‹ok› if they
succeed.

The ‹message› command causes the given message to be broadcast to
all users associated with the given channel, including the
originator. There is no other reply from the server. However, if the
target channel does not exist or the client is not currently
associated with it, the server replies with an ‹error› and does not
broadcast the message. The {nickname} in the ‹message› command
broadcast by the server is that of the originator of the message,
and the timestamp marks the moment when the server received the
command from the sending client.

Finally, the {replay} command causes the server to re-send all
‹message›s that the given channel received since the given timestamp
(i.e. with a timestamp that is greater or equal to the one given by
the client). The server gives ‹ok› before resending any messages if
the request was valid (even in the case that there are no matching
messages). The command results in an ‹error› (and no message replay)
in case the client is not associated with the channel, or if the
timestamp is in the future according to the server clock.

If the client sends multiple commands without waiting for replies,
the replies from the server should come in the order of the commands
received. Any ‹message› commands going from the server to the client
are, however, asynchronous to the rest of the command stream,
including ‹message› commands generated in response to a ‹replay›.

The server must remain responsive at all times and to all clients,
including during playback of long message histories in response to a
‹replay› command.  It is strongly encouraged that you program the
server in an async style, using the ‹asyncio› library.
