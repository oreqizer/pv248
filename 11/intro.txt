# Numeric Math

Since Python is often used as a driver for numeric algorithms, with
‹numpy› as the backend, we will try to explore some of its basic
functions. The first part will focus on linear algebra.

 1. ‹linear.py› – warm up
 2. ‹volume.py› – volume of n-dimensional polyhedra [0.5 points]
 3. ‹null.py› – the nullspace (kernel) of a matrix

While in the second we will look at signal processing.

 4. ‹histogram.py› – drawing histograms
 5. ‹sig.py› – generating signals [0.5 points]
 6. ‹dft.py› – analysing signals [0.5 points]
