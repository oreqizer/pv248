## Peer Reviews

You can optionally participate in peer reviews, both as a reviewer
and as a review recipient. Reviewers get points for their effort,
the recipients do not, but instead get (hopefully) useful
information.

### Requesting Reviews

If you would like to have your code reviewed, you can issue the
following command:

    $ pv248 review --request hw1

Substitute other assignments for ‹hw1› as appropriate. You can
request a review on an assignment which you did not pass yet.  You
may get up to 3 reviews for any given request. The reviewer will
work with the submission that was current at the time they agreed to
do the review. Make sure you submit the code you want reviewed
before requesting the review.

The ‹pv248 update› command will indicate whether someone reviewed
your code, by printing a line of the form:

    A reviews/hw1.from.xlogin

To read the review, look at the files in
‹~/pb161/reviews/hw1.from.xlogin› -- you will find a copy of your
submitted sources along with comments provided by the reviewer.
After you read your review, you should write a few sentences for the
reviewer into ‹note.txt› in the review directory (please wrap lines
to 80 columns) and then run:

    $ pb161 review --accept 100

Instead of 100, you can use a smaller number, indicating what percentage of
the points the reviewer deserves for their job. Please make sure that you
grade the review honestly -- the reviews will be screened for abuse and
depending on the type of misconduct, one or both parties will be punished.

### Writing Reviews

To participate as a reviewer, start with the following command:

    $ pv248 review --list

You will get a list of review requests for which you are an eligible
reviewer.  In particular, only assignments that you have already
successfully solved will show up. If you like one of the entries,
note its number (e.g. 7) and type:

    $ pv248 review --checkout 7
    $ cd ~/pv248/reviews/
    $ ls

There will be a directory for each of the reviews you agreed to
write. Each directory contains the source code submitted for review,
along with further instructions (the file ‹readme.txt›).

When inserting your comments, please use double ‹##› to make the
comment stand out, like this:

    ## A longer comment should be wrapped to 80 columns or less,
    ## and each line should start with the ## marker.

You can write up to 10 reviews, each for a maximum of 0.3 points (and a total
of 3 points). The limit is applied at checkout time: once you agree to do a
particular review, you cannot change your mind and ‘uncheckout’ it to reclaim
one of the 10 slots.
