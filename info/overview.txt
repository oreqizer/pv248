## Course Overview

Welcome to PV248 Programming in Python. In a normal semester, the
course consists of lectures, seminars and assignments. This is not a
normal semester: the course will be entirely online, and your
primary source of information will be this collection of code
examples and exercises. There are a few lecture recordings from
previous years, but only one or so is in English.

Since this is a programming subject, most of the coursework – and
grading – will center around actual programming. There will be 2
types of programs that you will write in this seminar: tiny programs
for weekly exercises (15-20 minutes each) and small programs for
homework (a few hundred lines).

Writing programs is hard and this course won't be entirely easy
either. You will need to put in effort to pass the subject.
Hopefully, you will have learned something by the end of it.

Further details on the organisation of this course are in this
directory:

 • ‹grading.txt› -- what is graded and how; what you need to pass,
 • ‹homework.txt› -- general guidelines that govern assignments,
 • ‹reviews.txt› -- writing and receiving peer reviews,
 • ‹advisors.txt› -- whom to talk to and how when you need help.

Study materials for each week are in directories ‹01› through ‹13›.
Start by reading ‹intro.txt›. Assignments are in directories ‹hw1›
through ‹hw6› and will be made available according to the schedule
shown in ‹grading.txt›.
