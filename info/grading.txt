## Grading

To pass the subject, you need to collect a total of 18 points (by
any means). The points can be obtained as follows (these are upper
limits):

 • 12 points for homework (6 assignments, 2 points each)
 •  9 points for weekly exercises, 
 •  6 points for finishing your homework early,
 •  3 points for peer review.

You need to pass the 18 point mark by 17th of February, one week
after the last deadline of the last homework (this gives you some
space to collect the remaining points via peer review).

### Homework

There will be 6 assignments, one every two weeks. There will be 8
deadlines for each of them, one week apart and each deadline gives
you one chance to pass the automated test suite. If you pass on the
first or second deadline, you get 1 extra point for the assignment.
For the third and fourth deadlines, the bonus is reduced to 0.5
point. Afterwards, you only get the baseline 2 points.

The deadline schedule is as follows:

The test suite is strictly binary: you either pass or you fail. More
details and guidelines are in ‹homework.txt›.

### Weekly Exercises

Besides homework assignments, the main source of points will be
weekly exercises. Like with homework, you are not required to do any
of these (except to get sufficient points to pass the course). How
you split points between homework and the weekly exercises is up to
you.

Each week, you will be able to submit a fixed subset of the
exercises given to you (i.e. we will select usually 2, sometimes
perhaps 3 exercises, which you can submit and get the point). Each
week, you will be able to get up to one point (so in theory,
12 points are available, but the maximum you can earn this way is
capped at 9). The point will be split between the exercises, i.e.
it will be possible to earn fractional points in a given week, too.

If bonuses are present in an exercise, those are not required in
submissions (nor they are rewarded with points).

The exercises have test cases enclosed: it is sufficient to pass
those test cases to earn the associated points. The deadlines to
earn points are as follows (you will have 2 weeks to solve each
set):

### Peer Review

Reading code is an important skill – sometimes more so than writing
it. While the space to practice reading code in this subject is
limited, you will still be able to earn a few points doing just
that. The rules for peer review are as follows:

 • «only homework» is eligible for reviews (not the weekly
   exercises),
 • you can submit any code (even completely broken) for peer review,
 • to write a review for any given submission, you must have already
   passed the respective assignment yourself,
 • there are no deadlines for requesting or providing peer reviews
   (other than the deadline on passing the subject),
 • writing a review is worth 0.3 points and you can write at most
   10.

It is okay to point out correctness problems during peer reviews,
with the expectation that this might help the recipient pass the
assignment. This is the «only» allowed form of cooperation (more on
that below).

### Plagiarism

Copying someone else's work or letting someone else copy yours will
earn you -6 points per instance. You are also responsible for
keeping your solutions private. If you only use the ‹pv248› command
on ‹aisa›, it will make your ‹~/pv248› directory inaccessible to
anyone else (this also applies to school-provided UNIX
workstations). Keep it that way. If you work on your solution using
other computers, make sure they are secure. Do not publish your
solutions anywhere (on the internet or otherwise). All parties in a
copying incident will be treated equally.

No cooperation is allowed (not even design-level discussion about
how to solve the exercise) on homework and on weekly exercises
«which you submit». If you want to study with your classmates, that
is okay – but only cooperate on exercises which are not going to be
submitted by either party.
