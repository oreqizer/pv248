# Operators, Iterators, Decorators and Exceptions

This week, we will look at some of the more advanced language
features of Python.

The first couple of exercises will be about iterators and
generators:

 1. ‹iter.py› – simple iterators [submit for 0.5 points]
 2. ‹flat.py› – a simple generator

We will then move on to operator overloading:

 3. ‹poly.py› – polynomials
 4. ‹mod.py› – finite rings of integers mod N (ℤ/nℤ)

Finally, the last will cover exceptions and decorators:

 5. ‹with.py› – context managers vs exceptions
 6. ‹trace.py› – decorators part 1 [submit for 0.5 points]
 7. ‹noexcept.py› – decorators and exceptions
