# Implement the cross product and check the following properties:
#  • anti-commutativity
#  • distributivity over addition
#  • compatibility with scalar multiplication:
#    ra × b = a × rb = r(a × b)
#  • Jacobi identity: a × (b × c) + b × (c × a) + c × (a × b) = 0
#  • weak cancellation: (a × b) - (a × c) = 0 → a × (b - c) = 0

# Check all of them on integer inputs and on floating point inputs.

# Enough with math, let's do some computer science instead: see
# ‹sort.py›.
