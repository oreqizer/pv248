# 1. Implement the standard dot product on integer vectors.
# 2. Use hypothesis to check its properties:
#    ◦ commutativity
#    ◦ distributivity over addition
#    ◦ bilinearity a⋅(b + c) = a⋅(rb + c) = r(a⋅b) + (a⋅c)
#    ◦ compatibility with scalar multiplication: (r₁a)⋅(r₂b) = r₁r₂(a⋅b)
# 3. Check the same but with floating point values.
#    ◦ be prepared for all sorts of weirdness (big numbers, tiny
#      numbers, inf, nan)

def dot( a, b ):
    pass

def test_commutativity():
    pass

# etc.

# Let's try another operation, the cross product, in ‹cross.py›.
