# Testing

This week will cover ‹hypothesis›, a rather useful tool for testing
Python code. Hypothesis is a «property-based» testing system: unlike
traditional unit testing, we do not specify exact inputs. Instead,
we provide a description of an entire class of inputs; ‹hypothesis›
then randomly samples the space of all inputs in that class,
invoking our test cases for each such sample.

Unlike other weeks, you won't get pre-made tests, since writing
tests is the point of the exercises. To get started, try e.g.
‹https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html›.

We will look at two types of programs to use hypothesis with, first
some integer and floating-point linear math:

 1. ‹inner.py› – properties of the inner vector product
 2. ‹cross.py› – same but cross product

And some classic computer science problems:

 4. ‹sort.py› – sorting algorithms
 5. ‹bsearch.py› – binary search
 6. ‹heap.py› – binary heaps
