# Python Intro

There are two sets of exercises in the first week (exercises within
each set are related). The first set is an evaluator of simple
expressions in reverse polish notation (files prefixed ‹rpn_›) and
the other is about planar analytic geometry (simple geometric
objects, their attributes, transformations on them and interactions
between them; these files are prefixed ‹geom_›). Each of the two
blocks is split into three exercises.

One thing that you will need but might not be familiar with is
«variadic functions»: see ‹varargs.py› for an introduction.

The order in which the exercises were meant to be solved is this:

 1. ‹rpn_un.py›
 2. ‹rpn_bin.py› (can be submitted)
 3. ‹rpn_gen.py›

 4. ‹geom_types.py›
 5. ‹geom_intersect.py› (can be submitted)
 6. ‹geom_dist.py›

It is okay to flip the two blocks, but the exercises within each
block largely build on each other and cannot be as easily skipped or
reordered.
