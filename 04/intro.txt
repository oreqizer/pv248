# SQL

This week, we will look at some basic SQL. First, we will import and
export JSON data to/from an SQL database and perform simple
searches. The schema for all three exercises is in ‹books.sql›.

 1. ‹book_import.py› – import data into a database [0.5 pts]
 2. ‹book_export.py› – the converse
 3. ‹book_query.py› – use SQL to search for things

The second part will build up a very simple CRUD-type application
(CRUD = Create Read Update Delete). The interface will be through
Python objects. The subject will be shopping lists. The second
exercise in the set can be submitted (though you will need to also
include the first, which will not be graded on its own).

 4. ‹list_create.py› – creating shopping lists
 5. ‹list_search.py› – searching and reading [0.5 pts]
 6. ‹list_update.py› – update and delete
