# SQL

This week, we will look at some basic SQL. First, we will import and
export JSON data to/from an SQL database and perform simple
searches. The schema for all three exercises is in ‹books.sql›.

 1. ‹book_import.py› – import data into a database
 2. ‹book_export.py› – the converse
 3. ‹book_query.py› – use SQL to search for things

[TBD] The second part will build up a very simple CRUD-type
application (CRUD = Create Read Update Delete). The interface will
be through Python objects. The subject will be shopping lists.

 4. ‹list_make.py› – creating shopping lists
 5. ‹list_search.py› – searching and reading
 6. ‹list_update.py› – update and delete
