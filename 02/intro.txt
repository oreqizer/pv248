# Python Intro

In the second week, there is one set of 3 related and another set of
3 standalone exercises. The first set is a mock ‘reimplement a
legacy system’ story. If something appears to be stupid, blame the
original authors. They were overworked programmers too, probably
fresh out of school.

The first set contains:

 1. ‹ts3_escape.py›
 2. ‹ts3_normalize.py› (this one can be submitted)
 3. ‹ts3_render.py› [tbd]

The second set contains exercises which make use of the basic
built-in classes, like ‹dict›, ‹set›, ‹list›, ‹str› and so on:

 • ‹merge.py› (this one can be submitted)
 • ‹rewrite.py› – fun with rewrite systems
 • ‹magic.py› – identifying file types
