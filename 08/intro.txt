# More ‹asyncio›

While the lecture this weeks goes into low-level details of
‹asyncio›, we will stick with the high-level interface. We will
write some simple servers and clients using sockets.

Simple async servers:

 1. ‹tcp-echo.py›
 2. ‹unix-rot13.py› [submit for 0.5 points]
 3. ‹unix-merge.py› [bonus! submit for 0.5 points]

Passing data between native (‹async def›) coroutines:

 4. ‹pipeline.py›
 5. ‹tokenize.py› (tbd)
 6. ‹minilisp.py› [submit for 0.5 points]
